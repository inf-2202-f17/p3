# Third mandatory assignment: techniques for working with cloud-scale datasets

In this exercise set you will get hands on experience with some techniques and concepts that often turn up when working with cloud systems and data. You will be using Azure Data Lake, which is a public cloud offering based on previously internal Microsoft technology. These are tools that close to every developer at the Microsoft office here in Tromsø has worked with at some point. World-wide, this technology – together with other systems – power reporting and logging pipelines for most (if not all) large Microsoft services.

The full assignment text is in [p3.pdf in the P3 folder](https://github.com/inf-2202-f17/p3/blob/master/P3/p3.pdf). The repo also contains the slides from the presentation of this assignment.

# Practical info

* This should as usual be cloned through [the classroom link](TODO). 
* The deadline is Friday, November 3rd. at 23h00. 
* The report should not be more than 3 pages long. 
* We expect you to seriously report and discuss performance evaluation and the different things that the assignment text instructs you to consider. Follow the advice from Åge's and Steffen's lectures. Skip the technical background.
* We expect you to have tried running in the cloud. The free trial asks you to provide a credit card, but spending real money after the trial credits run out is opt-in. So you shouldn't be nervous about your money.
